# Wine-Taste-Predictions
Part of a Python class Final Project. In a group of 3 we were tasked with identifying a dataset, 
cleaning it, and then performing some simple analysis on it in order to produce visualizations and 
predictions which we could test.

Our group chose to examine a Machine Learning Repository Wine Quality dataset which was organized around 
a large number of wine attributes and ratings attributed to each wine by professional wine testers. We were interested in
2 things. First, could we accurately predict a wine's rating based on its chemistry. Second, could we 
accurately predict if a wine was red or white based off of its chemistry.

We presented these results to the class and produced several visualizations to help people understand the nature of our data and
the effectiveness of our models.
